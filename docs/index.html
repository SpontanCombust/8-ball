      <h1>8-Ball Pool Game</h1>

      <p>Use the mouse to aim your cue and left click to place and hit the white ball</p>
      <br>
      <p>Aim of the game is for each of the player to score balls of their respective variant:</p>
      <p>Player 1 has to score solid balls, whereas player 2 has to score striped ones.</p>
      <p>One exception here is the black balled with number 8</p>
      <p>Black ball should be scored by any player by the end of the game to win</p>
      <p>Scoring the black ball before all other player's balls means automatic loss.</p>
      <p>Scoring the white ball means round loss</p>
